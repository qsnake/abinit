!!****d* ABINIT/53_ffts
!! NAME
!! 53_ffts
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!! This directory contains level-2 routines related 
!! to Fast Fourier Transform within the ABINIT package.
!! Most come from the Corning version of Stefan Goedecker's package,
!! written in F77 in 1994, and have been translated
!! to F90 and ABINIT's style.
!! The two entry points to ABINIT FFTs are fourwf.f and fourdp.f .
!! The indexing of planewaves on the FFT grid is also done
!! by routines in this directory :
!! boundy.f, indfft.f and kgindex.f .
!! The more recent 2002 version of Stefan Goedecker's FFTs
!! are contained in Lib_fftnew
